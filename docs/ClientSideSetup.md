# Usage

## Client-side Setup

Once you have your [server-side framework configured](ServerSideSetup.md), you then need to [setup your client-side framework](https://inertiajs.com/client-side-setup). This plugin leverages [AssetMix plugin](https://github.com/ishanvyas22/asset-mix/tree/cake3) so you don't have to install all the front-end dependencies one by one. Instead you can directly generate scaffolding(using above command) to quickly get started.

**Note:** As of now AssetMix plugin only supports front-end scaffolding for Vue.js. If you want to use any other client side framework you can do so, refer [this](https://inertiajs.com/client-side-setup) link to know more.
